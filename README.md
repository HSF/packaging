# HSF Packaging Working Group

This is an umbrella project to keep track of building / packaging related action items and eventually implementations
for the [HSF Packaging Working Group](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/packaging.html)

# Umbrella Projects
## [Documents](documents)
A holdall for WG tech notes, documents, plus comments and links that don't yet fit elsewhere.

## [Package Manager Test Drives](testdrive)
This project provides "test drives" of identified package management and deployment tools to demonstrate how
they can be used to install a basic HEP software stack.

## [Instruction Set Tools](istools)
This project provides some notes and example C/C++ code for packaging software
that uses/requires specific CPU instruction sets such as SSE, AVX.

## [Relocatable Software](RelocatableSoftware)
This project provides some notes and example code for developing
packages that are _relocatable_. That is, the collection of installed
files can be moved from their installed location to anywhere else on
the system and still function without any system or user configuration
changes.
